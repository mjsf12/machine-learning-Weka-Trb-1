NAME
weka.classifiers.functions.Logistic

SYNOPSIS
Class for building and using a multinomial logistic regression model with a ridge estimator.

There are some modifications, however, compared to the paper of leCessie and van Houwelingen(1992): 

If there are k classes for n instances with m attributes, the parameter matrix B to be calculated will be an m*(k-1) matrix.

The probability for class j with the exception of the last class is

Pj(Xi) = exp(XiBj)/((sum[j=1..(k-1)]exp(Xi*Bj))+1) 

The last class has probability

1-(sum[j=1..(k-1)]Pj(Xi)) 
	= 1/((sum[j=1..(k-1)]exp(Xi*Bj))+1)

The (negative) multinomial log-likelihood is thus: 

L = -sum[i=1..n]{
	sum[j=1..(k-1)](Yij * ln(Pj(Xi)))
	+(1 - (sum[j=1..(k-1)]Yij)) 
	* ln(1 - sum[j=1..(k-1)]Pj(Xi))
	} + ridge * (B^2)

In order to find the matrix B for which L is minimised, a Quasi-Newton Method is used to search for the optimized values of the m*(k-1) variables.  Note that before we use the optimization procedure, we 'squeeze' the matrix B into a m*(k-1) vector.  For details of the optimization procedure, please check weka.core.Optimization class.

Although original Logistic Regression does not deal with instance weights, we modify the algorithm a little bit to handle the instance weights.

Note: Missing values are replaced using a ReplaceMissingValuesFilter, and nominal attributes are transformed into numeric attributes using a NominalToBinaryFilter.

OPTIONS
numDecimalPlaces -- The number of decimal places to be used for the output of numbers in the model.

batchSize -- The preferred number of instances to process if batch prediction is being performed. More or fewer instances may be provided, but this gives implementations a chance to specify a preferred batch size.

debug -- Output debug information to the console.

ridge -- Set the Ridge value in the log-likelihood.

useConjugateGradientDescent -- Use conjugate gradient descent rather than BFGS updates; faster for problems with many parameters.

maxIts -- Maximum number of iterations to perform.

doNotCheckCapabilities -- If set, classifier capabilities are not checked before classifier is built (Use with caution to reduce runtime).
